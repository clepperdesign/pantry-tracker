# pantry-tracker

The program now does the following:
- allows you to add new items to an external list
- adds item's purchase date, price, and name, as well as an eventual final-use date
- creates a custom class for these items with the above criterion as attributes
- calculates value of item as determined by price/(buydate-usedate)

Future update ideas:
- allow items to be removed
- deal with multiple items with the same name, and how to calulate a mean value (more advanced database than .txt file needed)
